  A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet(In this project letters are shifted by 5). This project allows users to easily encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.

Features:

- Encryption: Encrypt a text message by shifting each letter by 5(you can change as you like in code).
- Decryption: Decrypt an encrypted text message by reversing the shift.
- Handles Case Sensitivity: Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Non-Alphabetic Characters: Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) are preserved in the encrypted and decrypted text.

How to Use?

Encryption:

- Enter the text you want to encrypt.
- Press enter at the end of your message and after that type 'q' to quit.
- Now your message is saved to EncryptedMessage.txt.

Decryption:

- Select the option decrypt.
- And now the decrypted message of your encrypted message is saved to DecryptedMessage.txt.

Clear Messages:

- Choosse the option clear message to clear both EncryptedMessage.txt and DecryptedMessage.txt.


Example:

  Hereâ€™s an example of how the Caesar Cipher works:

Original Message: HELLO WORLD
Shift Value: 5
Encrypted Message: MJQQT BTWQI
Decrypted Message: HELLO WORLD
